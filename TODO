 - need to add a train as well as a test?
 - need to add the smarter searches like I did at uni

when hit unrepeatable change warning add ignore

automatic worker balancing (how many workers etc.)

improve validation

other smaller tasks:
- clear space on hard drive / make save less so don't hit hard drive space issues
- indexing of results to make things faster?
- make progress updating faster - caching changes

I think the key thing is to reduce the friction of 
a) Starting an experiment
b) Knowing when an experiment is finished
c) getting the key results from an expeirment.
